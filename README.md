# Introduction
The intention here is to give a first brief overview about using Fortran (since the Fortran 2018 ISO standard) for applying and extending the Fragmented Objects model, which originated in the late 1980’s and early 1990’s. <br />
To get started with the basic ideas behind the Fragmented Objects (FO) model, you may start reading ‘Makpangou, Mesaac & Gourhant, Yvon & Narzul, Jean-pierre. (1998). Fragmented Objects for Distributed Abstractions’. <br />
